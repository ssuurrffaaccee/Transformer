France : EIB lends EUR 50 million towards construction of Millau Viaduct
the viaduct is the sole part of the A75 being built under a private concession , with the remainder implemented entirely under the responsibility of the State in view of its role in improving access to the eastern part of the Massif Central .
given the high investment outlay , the French State has awarded the Eiffage Group , against levying of tolls , a 75 @-@ year concession for the project .
the EIB loan will enable the Group to diversify resources earmarked for financing the bridge and to improve their cost .
background information :
the EIB has vigorously stepped up its support for Trans @-@ European Networks ( TENs ) since these were identified by the December 1994 Essen European Council , together with their extension towards regions bordering on the EU .
since 1993 , the EIB has advanced EUR 59.2 billion for TENs , of which EUR 37 billion for transport TENs .
as the leading source of bank finance for large @-@ scale networks in Europe , the EIB is able to mobilise very substantial volumes of funds on terms tailored to the size of these projects .
it is involved in all major infrastructure projects in Europe , including those mounted under Public @-@ Private Partnerships ( PPPs ) , and has made available EUR 14 billion for transport @-@ sector PPPs .
examples include the Oresund link between Denmark and Sweden , the Rion Antirion bridge connecting the Peloponnese to central Greece , the second bridge over the Tagus in Lisbon , the second Severn bridge in England and the bridge linking the Isle of Skye to mainland Scotland .
France : EIB lends Brittany Region EUR 110 million for rail upgrading

EIB grants EUR 120 million loans for small- and medium @-@ scale investment projects in Hungary
global loans are credit lines to financial intermediaries ( partner Banks ) , which on @-@ lend the proceeds under their own management , at their own risk and own conditions for small or medium @-@ scale investment projects meeting EIB &apos;s criteria .
long @-@ term global loans of the EIB allow the partner banks to increase and diversify their long @-@ term funding sources and to step @-@ up their longer @-@ term financing of projects .
the range of EIB &apos;s partner banks also means more choice and should result in better service and lower financing costs for the final beneficiaries which are typically SMEs and public or private promoters of infrastructure projects .
the EUR 50 million loan to CIB will be used for financing small- and medium @-@ sized projects in the field of environmental protection , energy savings , infrastructure , industry , services or tourism .
by financing more than the usual 50 percent of project costs , EIB is providing an incentive for fast implementation and completion of investment projects .
the loans to K &amp; H and IEB will benefit from the SME Finance Facility , a special scheme promoted by the European Commission .
it provides EIB &apos;s partner banks with an incentive in the form of a specific contribution for supporting the development of a strong and competitive SME sector in the Accession Countries .
the two banks will be the first EIB partner banks benefiting from the SME FF in Hungary .
at the signing of the loans EIB Vice President , W. Roth , said : &quot;
the global loans will serve many purposes at once .
at the same time , they will contribute to the development of long @-@ term finance in Hungary which is crucial for financing of investment and catching up economically . &quot;
note to the editor :
the European Investment Bank , the financing arm of the European Union , has the task of supporting EU policies .
in 2001 , the Bank granted loans totalling EUR 36.8 billion , of which 31 billion within the EU .
the EIB is re @-@ financing its lending by issuing bonds on the international capital markets .
due to its AAA credit rating it is able to raise funds at the keenest terms .
being a non @-@ profit institution , the Bank passes on these terms to public and private project promoters as well as partner banks .
since 1990 the EIB has lent over EUR 19 billion to the Central- Eastern European Accession countries and has become the region &apos;s most important foreign source of finance .

EIB grants EUR 100 million loan to Bank Pekao for financing small- and medium @-@ scale projects in Poland
the global loan to Bank Polska Kasa Opieki S.A ( Bank Pekao ) and / or Pekao Leasing Sp. z o.o. serves to finance small- and medium @-@ scale projects in the field of environmental protection , energy savings , infrastructure ( incl. health and education infrastructure ) , industry , services or tourism in Poland .
final beneficiaries are , typically , SMEs ; and private or public promoters of any size and ownership for energy , environmental protection or infrastructure projects .
support to SMEs is a key priority during the remaining pre @-@ accession phase and will continue to be of high importance post enlargement .
at the same time , it will contribute to the development of term finance in Poland , which is crucial for financing investment and catching up economically .
the loan will allow the Pekao group to increase and diversify long @-@ term funding sources and therefore to step up its longer @-@ term financing of eligible projects .
furthermore , the global loan to Pekao which enjoys the second largest branch network in the country - will ensure continued competition among intermediaries throughout Poland , resulting in better service for the final beneficiaries and lower financing costs .
the loan is the first operation with Bank Pekao , the second largest bank in the whole Central and Eastern European ( CEE ) region in terms of assets .
Pekao &apos;s main strategic shareholder is UniCredito Italiano .
note to the editor :
over 1 billion went to Trans @-@ European road and rail networks ( TENs ) , with emphasis on upgrading major international road and railway axes .
telecommunications , gas and larger industry schemes also attracted substantial loans from the EIB .
small and medium @-@ scale industrial investments as well as smaller energy or infrastructure projects are being furthered through credit lines ( global loans ) to commercial banks established in Poland .
the EIB also helped rebuild infrastructure damaged during the 1997 Odra and 2001 Vistula floods .
in the last years , EIB has undertaken efforts to better establish the global loan product in Poland .
global loans now represent 15 % of EIB total lending to Poland of over EUR 5.5 billion .
while this is above the accession countries &apos; average of 13 % , it is substantially below the EU average , reflecting the still more difficult operating environment and the lower development of term lending to SMEs and small municipalities in comparison with the EU .

2001 a record year for EIB lending in mediterranean partner countries : EUR 1.5 billion
active in the region since 1974 , the EIB has granted loans worth over EUR 9 billion in the &quot; Barcelona Process &quot; countries .
its annual rate of lending has continued to grow , rising from EUR 680 million in 1996 to almost EUR 1.5 billion in 2001 , thus positioning the EIB as one of the leading sources of bank financing for the sustainable development of the 12 Mediterranean Partner Countries .
its loans cover all sectors of the economy : the EUR 7.4 billion advanced over the past six years ( 1996 @-@ 2001 ) broke down as follows 1 ) 27.6 % for supporting the private sector ; 2 ) 24.6 % for safeguarding the environment ; 3 ) 26.4 % for harnessing and distributing energy resources ; 4 ) 21.5 % for communications .
with a budget of EUR 7.4 billion up to 2007 , the EIB is set to pump substantial financial resources into the Mediterranean Partner Countries : EUR 6.4 billion under the mandate conferred by the Union , and EUR 1 billion under the &quot; Euro @-@ Mediterranean Facility &quot; set up by the EIB in the wake of the Nice European Council ( December 2000 ) for regional energy , communications and environmental projects .
three priorities for sustainable development
under the Euro @-@ Mediterranean Partnership , Bank activity in support of the beneficiary countries &apos; policy of economic development and openness focuses on three priorities :
such backing for the private sector is designed to boost the competitiveness of the Mediterranean Partner Countries &apos; economies with a view to creating a free trade area with the Union by 2010 .
it takes the form of long @-@ term loans and risk capital ( especially for SMEs ) made available to companies in close cooperation with the local banking and financial sector , so contributing to its modernisation .
in 2001 , 25 % of EIB loans supported this objective in Tunisia , Egypt , Turkey and Malta via an investment fund operating throughout this area .
this activity , which in the 1996 @-@ 2001 period represented on average a quarter of annual lending , rose dramatically in 2001 to account for 34 % of loans ( EUR 580 million ) .
in particular , the EIB financed the improvement of drinking water supplies in 70 medium @-@ sized municipalities in Morocco , the Sahel region in Tunisia and Greater Algiers , as well as the modernisation of wastewater management in Turkey .
at the same time , EIB loans help to bolster and expand economic infrastructure communications , energy laying the foundations for development .
the EIB focuses in particular on financing the establishment of physical links , i.e. regional infrastructure facilitating &quot; South @-@ South &quot; cooperation and trade , the movement of persons and the use of common resources .
in 2001 , lending for such infrastructure accounted for 24 % of loans and targeted Morocco , Tunisia ( communications ) , Egypt , Syria ( energy ) and Cyprus ( health ) .
in geographical terms , EIB operations up to 2001 have generated a loan portfolio broken down as follows .
actively promoting these three priorities , EIB loans are characterised by the &quot; value added &quot; which they bring by virtue of the role of financial catalyst played by the Bank , whose involvement in a project serves to attract other sources of international , bilateral or local financing .
this value added also takes the form of financial engineering tailored to long @-@ term project requirements .
lastly , the EIB contributes to improving the technical and economic definition of projects by applying the same standards and appraisal criteria in these countries as in the Union .
outlook : helping to revitalise the Euro @-@ Mediterranean Partnership
in line with its role as the Union &apos;s financing institution , the EIB is committed to supporting a shift in the direction of the Euro @-@ Mediterranean Partnership towards increased economic and financial cooperation between the European Union and the countries of the region , while deploying new financial instruments .
in particular , the EIB plans to expand its activity in the following areas :
supporting the Union &apos;s action to promote an area of peace and stability throughout the Mediterranean region .
in 2001 , the Bank &apos;s most important operations were in Algeria and Syria , countries with which relations have been renewed or enhanced , as well as in Egypt and Morocco , the prime beneficiaries of EIB loans .
for some time , the EIB has also been making a substantial contribution towards the economic development of the Middle East with EUR 1.9 billion granted over the past six years .
it has especially focused on financing basic infrastructure in Gaza / West Bank , SMEs in Jordan and the West Bank , energy infrastructure in Syria and the reconstruction of Lebanon .
fostering the growth of inter @-@ regional cooperation through its backing for projects which engender closer ties between the Mediterranean Partner Countries ( &quot; South @-@ South &quot; cooperation ) or with the Union ( &quot; South @-@ North &quot; cooperation ) .
having established its EUR 1 billion &quot; Euro @-@ Mediterranean Facility , &quot; deployed at the EIB &apos;s own risk in support of regional projects in the communications , energy and environmental protection sectors , the EIB has a wealth of experience in evaluating and financing such projects based on successful precedents , such as the gradual construction of the Trans @-@ Maghreb motorway ( Morocco @-@ Algeria @-@ Tunisia ) , the Syria @-@ Turkey and Egypt-
Jordan electrical interconnections , the telecoms interconnection between Jordan and its neighbouring countries , the Euro @-@ Med gas pipeline ( Algeria @-@ Morocco @-@ Spain ) , the Spain @-@ Morocco electrical interconnection , the Europe @-@ Morocco telecoms interconnection , port developments in Morocco , Tunisia , Jordan and Lebanon , as well as Beirut Airport .
underpinning foreign direct investment by the Union in the Mediterranean Partner Countries and the creation of joint ventures between European and local operators .
devising loans for projects with a social dimension : in 2001 , the EIB elected to underpin projects directly assisting populations in difficulty ( drinking water supplies for Greater Algiers ) or improving access to optimal services in the health sector ( Nicosia Hospital ) .
it is actively preparing to expand its operations in the fields of health and education in the Mediterranean Partner Countries .

EIB Group strengthens support for EU policies
the European Investment Bank lent EUR 36.8 billion in 2001 for capital investment supporting European Union policy objectives , of which EUR 31.2 billion for projects within the EU Member States .
in the Accession Countries , EIB advanced EUR 2.7 billion for investment underpinning preparations for enlargement .
EIB also confirmed its influential role in promoting growth and stability in the Mediterranean region , providing EUR 1.4 billion for projects supporting the modernisation of economies in the European Mediterranean Partnership Countries and EUR 320 million for investment in the reconstruction of the Balkans .
under the framework of the EU &apos;s development and co @-@ operation policies , EIB lent EUR 520 million in the African , Caribbean and Pacific ( ACP ) Countries , EUR 150 million in South Africa , EUR 178 million in Asia and EUR 365 million in Latin America .
the EIB Group &apos;s venture capital arm , the European Investment Fund ( EIF ) , invested EUR 800 million in venture capital operations and advanced up to EUR 960 million for SME guarantees .
to finance its lending , the Bank raised EUR 32.3 billion on capital markets through 148 transactions in 13 currencies .
outstanding borrowings totalled EUR 176 billion and outstanding loans amounted to EUR 221 billion .
supporting EU policies
in line with this , the Group developed activities to support innovation , high @-@ technology and human capital investment through its &quot; Innovation 2000 Initiative &quot; ( i2i ) , launched in response to the Lisbon Council ( March 2000 ) .
at the same time , EIB reinforced its co @-@ ordination with the European Commission to further operational synergies in implementing EU policies , signing a Joint Memorandum to boost research and technological innovation , as well as joining forces to promote Europe &apos;s film and audio @-@ visual industries .
the two institutions also co @-@ operated in furthering regional development , Trans @-@ European Networks , environment , entrepreneurship amongst innovative small and medium @-@ sized enterprises ( SMEs ) , education and health , and in the enlargement and Euro @-@ Med Partnership processes .
under its &quot; i2i &quot; programme , EIB is to lend up to EUR 12 @-@ 15 billion over the years 2000 @-@ 2003 .
EIB Group contributed to this objective through its long @-@ term loans and the strengthened capacity of the European Investment Fund to support investment helping to reinforce the capital base of innovative SMEs .
EIF &apos;s operations also continued to be actively supported by the European Commission , a major EIF shareholder , particularly in developing facilities for SME guarantees .
lending highlights in 2001
Europe &apos;s less advanced regions
regional development continued to be EIB &apos;s lending priority with aggregate EUR 22.2 billion in both the EU Member States and the Accession Countries .
within the European Union , EUR 14.5 billion ( i.e.
in the Accession Countries , a future area of the Union &apos;s regional policy , the Bank provided EUR 2.7 billion .
within the Union , the Cohesion Countries ( Spain , Greece , Ireland and Portugal ) attracted EUR 7 billion of individual loans , while EUR 1.8 billion were advanced for projects in the Eastern Länder of Germany and over EUR 1 billion for Italy &apos;s Mezzogiorno .
noteworthy was the Bank &apos;s first participation in the Community Support Framework Programme ( 2000 @-@ 2006 ) for investment in the Basilicata Region of Italy .
innovation and human capital
EIB financing in support of Europe &apos;s information and knowledge @-@ based economy amounted to EUR 5 billion in 2001 .
since May 2000 , EIB has approved EUR 9.1 billion for &quot; i2i &quot; investment in research and development , information and communications technology networks , dissemination of innovation , the development of entrepreneurship among innovative SMEs , and human capital formation .
EIB launched its first human capital oriented operations in the Accession Countries - in Lodz , Poland , and Nicosia , Cyprus .
the European Investment Fund boosted its venture capital operations in 2001 , despite difficult market conditions .
57 operations were concluded for EUR 800 million in all EU countries ( first operations in Greece and Portugal ) and in 5 Accession Countries .
the EIF &apos;s investment strategy is to concentrate on hi @-@ tech and early stage funds .
its overall venture capital portfolio totals EUR 2.2 billion .
the EIF is now the main investor in the early stage market in Europe , representing a segment where risks are highest , the resources scarce and the strategic needs of the EU most evident .
SME guarantees , which , through their important leverage effect allow banks and financial intermediaries to extend their lending activity to more SMEs , represented EUR 960 million under 39 operations in 2001 .
the total guarantee portfolio now represents EUR 3.3 billion and covers nearly 10 000 SMEs .
environment
it provided also EUR 484 million for environmental projects in Accession Countries .
trans @-@ European Networks ( TENs )
strong support for TENs and other infrastructure of European or regional interest totalled EUR 7.2 billion .
this brings EIB support for TENs over the last five years to EUR 43.6 billion .
other key features were the support for a growing number of Public Private Partnerships , both in EU and Accession Countries , and the launch of a co @-@ operation scheme between the EIB Group and the European Commission for equity investment in TENs projects .
accession Countries
EIB continued to finance projects in the Accession Countries ( including Cyprus and Malta ) , reaching some EUR 2.7 billion in the year , bringing total lending since 1990 to EUR 16.6 billion .
lending was focused on the preparation of the countries for enlargement .
key importance was attributed , again , to loans in support of the transport and communication infrastructure interlinking the region , and the region with the EU ( 56 % of total lending ) .
special emphasis was given to environmental investments ( 20 % ) in order to help the candidate countries to meet the EU &apos;s environmental standards .
transport and environmental projects have been co @-@ financed , in a number of cases , with grant money from the EU &apos;s ISPA programme .
EIB extended its scope of lending to the health and education infrastructure , which requires substantial investment , and financed first projects in the Accession Countries .
in addition , EIB was offering strong support to foreign direct investment , which contributes to the transfer of both , know @-@ how and capital , into the region .
attempts to consolidate public budgets and national elections in Poland , Romania and Bulgaria delayed public investment decisions .
therefore , total lending in the candidate countries was somewhat below the record volume achieved in 2000 .
Mediterranean Partner Countries
as the foremost multilateral financier in the region , EIB increased its lending in the Mediterranean Partner Countries to EUR 1.4 billion .
priority was given to projects that support the Barcelona Process &apos; objective of promoting economic development in the region .
a special focus was on infrastructure schemes , the protection of the environment and SME development , with EUR 330 million committed in favour of SMEs under global loan allocations .
EUR 580 million went to schemes in the water , energy and infrastructure sectors improving the environment .
the Bank continued to help strengthen the private sector .
EIB is also widening its action into the human capital sectors of health and education , where new projects have been identified .
during the year , the Bank extended the scope of its activities by establishing a &quot; Mediterranean Partnership Facility &quot; under which it is to lend an additional EUR 1 billion by 2007 for large transport , energy and environmental cross @-@ regional projects .
Balkans
EIB made a major contribution in committing up to EUR 320 million in 2001 for a number of key investment projects in the sectors of infrastructure and industry in the Western Balkans ( Albania , Bosnia @-@ Herzegovina , Croatia , Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and FYROM ) .
special emphasis is being given to financing cross @-@ border regional projects in transportation and energy under the international @-@ sponsored infrastructure programme .
having played a leading role in the co @-@ ordination and financing of the initial Infrastructure Reconstruction programme launched in 2000 , EIB is also to contribute to the new EUR 2.4 billion Regional Infrastructure Package .
its role will in particular relate to the reconstruction and rehabilitation of roads , rail and power infrastructure .
in 2001 , the Bank also concluded its first global loan agreements with intermediary banks , promoting the modernization of the local financial sector and SME investment .
borrowing highlights in 2001
to finance its operations , the Bank raised EUR 32.3 billion through 148 transactions in 13 currencies ( before swaps ) on capital markets .
during the year , EIB continued to strongly support the euro , launching EUR 10 billion in 4 benchmark issues , including a new five billion Global ( 2007 ) .
at the end of 2001 , the euro benchmark yield curve had an outstanding amount of almost EUR 40 billion .
based on market reactions to its EUR 5 billion issue , the Bank was awarded Euroweek &apos;s &quot; Supranational bond issue of the Year 2001 . &quot;
resources borrowed before swaps in the three major currencies were : 41 % USD , 32 % EUR and 21 % GBP .
the US Dollar was the prime currency of funding , reflecting the favourable borrowing conditions .
after swaps , the euro accounted for 67 % ( generated partly via currency swaps ) , with GBP at 21 % and USD at 8 % .

the EIB loan - representing the first tranche of an overall approved financing of EUR 70 million in favour of the project - is made available to the Republic of Cyprus for the Cypriot Ministry of Finance , Department of Information Technology Services ( DITS ) .

it concerns investments in IT systems in various Cypriot Government Departments , encompassing investments in physical networks and hardware with the development of specialized software systems .
the enhancement of the Public Administration &apos;s IT systems is a major target for the Cypriot Government , as it is considered essential for ensuring a successful integration of Cyprus into the EU .
the project is therefore also in line with the EU &apos;s e @-@ Government initiatives for Acceding and Accession countries .
